AMD&nbsp;has implemented this standard in their recent Application Processor Units (APUs), and now Numba can compile code to run on these devices. It is Numba\u2019s mission to help Python developers take advantage of the full power of their computers with the help of just-in-time (JIT) compilation. We\u2019ve seen numerous examples where compiling numerical Python code has resulted in 2-5x speed improvements over code calling NumPy functions, and more than 150x over pure Python&nbsp;code.</span></p>", "date": "Thursday, April 28, 2016", "image": {"src": "https://www.anaconda.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/webinar_amd_0.png", "alt": "Blowing the Doors Off Bottlenecks with Python on AMD APUs"}, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-CKVxR8nCM&list=PLGB9meziqbzqyUT-V72ooDh0sda5dkh1d", "utm_campaign": "", "presenters": [], "categories": [], "tags": ["webinar"], "uri": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-CKVxR8nCM&list=PLGB9meziqbzqyUT-V72ooDh0sda5dkh1d", "banner": "https://www.anaconda.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/webinar_amd_0.png", "image_file": "webinar_amd_0.png", "image_file_path": "/home/kekker/.anaconda/navigator/images/webinar_amd_0.png"}, {"id": "723", "sticky": "", "title": "Visualizing 1 Billion Points of Data: Doing It Right", "subtitle": "Use Datashading to Interactively Visualize Big Data Sets", "summary": "<h4 style=\"line-height: 20.0063px;\">February 9, 2016</h4><p>Visualization is the best way to explore and communicate insights about data.
