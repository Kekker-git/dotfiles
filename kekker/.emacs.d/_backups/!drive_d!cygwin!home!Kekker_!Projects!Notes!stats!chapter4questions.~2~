     If the probability is 0.40 that steam will condense in
     a thin-walled aluminum tube at 10 atm pressure, use
     the formula for the binomial distribution to find the
     probability that, under the stated conditions, steam
     will condense in 4 of 12 such tubes.

     During one stage in the manufacture of indegrated cir- cuit chips, a
     coating must be applied. If 70% of chips receive a
     thick enough coating, use Table 1 or software to find

     1) [ ] at least 12 will have thick enough coatings
     2) [ ] at most 6 will have thick enough coatings
     3) [ ] exactly 10 will have thick enough coatings
